        No boosts is an extremely simple web application that lets you see
        the posts made by a fediverse user, excluding boosts. It can filter
        toots without mentions and supports custom emoji.
        </p>
        <p>To use it, you need to enter the URL of a user's page (just open it
        in a new tab and copy its location), it won't work with usernames.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Why?</b> Sometimes you want to follow someone who boosts a lot of
        others' posts. You can follow them and hide their boosts, but there's no
        way to find out how will their timeline look before following them. Using
        this tool, you can get a preview. (Of course, it doesn't include
        followers-only toots, as those aren't accessible before following.)
